# Dealing with refactoring and Ant Design

Talking a bit about Ant Design.

Today I implemented a Table Component using ant design in React and it worked really good. I had to deal with some refactoring and I will talk about it here.

Previously, I had a table component that was made in a rather complex way, using react-table:

```tsx
<Table tableInstance={ tableInstance } hasPagination={ true }/>
```
The problem is that ```tableInstance``` is a variable highly coupled in an zustand store, and this made the table component also very coupled, with many lines of code and many responsibilities.
Basically:
```tsx
const tableInstance = useTable(
    {
      columns: [...columns],
      data: [...data],
      initialState: {
        sortBy: [
          {
            id: 'id',
            desc: false,
          },
        ],
        filters: tableFilters ? tableFilters : [],
        globalFilter: tableGlobalFilter ? tableGlobalFilter : '',
        pageIndex: tablePage ? tablePage : paginationSettings.pageIndex,
        pageSize: paginationSettings.pageSize,
      },
    },
    useFilters,
    useGlobalFilter,
    useSortBy,
    usePagination
  );
```
```tablePage```, ```tableFilters```, and ```tableGlobalFilter``` were variables that came from a store, created specifically for this component.
In addition to this, the 'use' hooks from react-table were passed to all components that instantiated this table. In other words, there is a great deal of code repetition and unnecessary complexity.



```tsx 
import { Table } from 'antd';
import { TableProps } from "antd/es/table";

const TableComponent = (props: TableProps<any>) => {
	return (
		<Table
			size={ "small" }
			bordered={ true }
			loading={ props.loading }
			onChange={ props.onChange }
			dataSource={ props.dataSource }
			columns={ props.columns }
			pagination={
			{
				showSizeChanger: true,
				showTotal: (total, range) => `${range[0]}-${range[1]} ${t('of')} ${total} ${t('items')}`,
				hideOnSinglePage: false,
				responsive: true,
			}}
		/>)
}
```
